# What is Pomodoro Technique

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It helps improve focus and productivity by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. Each interval is called a "Pomodoro," named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used.

## How to use:
1. **Pick a task** you want to work on.
2. **Set a timer** for 25 minutes and work on the task without interruptions.
3. **When the timer goes off**, take a 5-minute break.
4. **After four Pomodoros**, take a longer break, typically 15-30 minutes.

This technique helps maintain focus, reduce burnout, and track time spent on tasks.
